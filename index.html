<h1>Memphis Can't Wait! Here's why!</h1>
    <h2> YOUTH VOTERS ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF THE VOTING POPULATION, MAKING THEM A POWERFUL POLITICAL FORCE.
    </h2>
    <h3>The youth vote has the potential to be extremely influential in this country. While young voter participation in
        2016 declined by 2% from a record 52% at the 2008 election, today the voting population includes almost equal parts
        millennials and baby boomers.</h3>

<h2> YOUTH VOTE COUNTS</h2>
<h3>While young people make up a large portion the voting-eligible population, they're much less likely than those who are older to get out and vote. In 2016,
    only 19% of people aged 18-29 cast their ballot in the presidential election; at 49%, 45-64-year-olds accounted
    for the largest electorate last year.</h3>

<h2>YOUNG VOTERS ARE AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE GROUP</h2>
<h3>Currently, millennials are the most diverse voting group.So much so that the millennial electorate is
    expected to be the first demographic group with the ability to challenge the basic two-party system,
    potentially driving the need for alternative political parties whom millennials feel can represent the needs of a diverse
    population through a more inclusive agenda.
</h3>
<h2> THE YOUTH VOTE CAN SWAY THE ELECTION</h2>
<h3>So much so that the collective "youth vote" could actually sway the election. Millennials have been credited with the decisive vote in
    the 2012 election of Barack Obama for a second term as president;
    Obama won 67% of the national youth vote, proving more popular in crucial states such as Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio,</h3>
